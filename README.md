# Machine-Learning-Based-Fault-Detection-and-Protection-Method-for-Three-Phase-Inverter
A simulation-based project that implements a machine learning–driven fault detection and protection framework for a three-phase voltage source inverter using residual current analysis and real-time PWM shutdown logic.
